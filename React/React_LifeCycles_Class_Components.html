Methods in React Component Lifecycle
-The render() method is used to render HTML of the component in react.This method is required for a class based
component to render the DOM.It runs during the mounting and updating of your component.render() method should be pure
i.e. you cannot modify state inside it!

-The componentDidMount() method runs after the component output has been rendered to the DOM.
-The componentDidUpdate() method is invoked as soon as the updating happens. The most common use case for the
componentDidUpdate() method is updating the DOM in response to prop or state changes.
-The componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method is called just before the component is unmounted and destroyed.
Usually used to performed cleanups.
